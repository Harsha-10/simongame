###Gameplay:
Simon will start by showing you a pattern of colors and sounds. Pay close attention to the sequence.

###Your Turn:
1.After Simon has presented the pattern, it's your turn to repeat it.
2.Use the corresponding buttons or controls to replicate the pattern you just saw and heard.
3.Start by pressing the first color/sound in the sequence. Then, add the second, and so on, until you've repeated the entire pattern.

###Correct Sequence:
If you successfully repeat the entire sequence without any mistakes, Simon will add another color/sound to the pattern and present it to you again.
Continue to repeat the pattern as it gets longer and more complex.

###Mistake:
If you make a mistake by pressing the wrong color or in the wrong order, the game will end.
